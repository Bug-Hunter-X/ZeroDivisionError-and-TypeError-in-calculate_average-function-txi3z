This repository contains a Python function calculate_average that demonstrates two common errors: ZeroDivisionError and TypeError.  The bug.py file shows the original function with the errors, while bugSolution.py provides a corrected version.  The function calculates the average of a list of numbers. The original code fails if the input list is empty or contains non-numeric data. The solution includes robust error handling to gracefully handle these scenarios.
